Immersive Book Interface:
Displays all spells in a classic two-page book format, with distinct left and right pages.
Smart Table of Contents & Pagination:
Automatically generates two main sections in the table of contents: "Prepared Spells" and "All Spells," grouped by spell level.
Employs an optimized pagination logic to prevent level headers from being truncated or left alone at the bottom of a page, resulting in a cleaner layout.
Convenient Navigation:
Page Turn Buttons: Flip through pages one by one using the left and right arrow buttons.
Mouse Wheel Scrolling: Supports turning pages by scrolling the mouse wheel up and down for more intuitive and faster navigation.
TOC Jumping: Click on any spell in the table of contents to jump directly to its detailed description page.
Home Button: A "Home" button is available to instantly return to the first page of the table of contents.
Spell Details & Quick Casting:
Spell detail pages clearly display the spell's name, level, and full description.
High Degree of Customization:
Appearance Settings: Players can freely customize the spellbook window's width, height, background image, and font family.
Spell Icons: An option in the settings allows users to show or hide spell icons next to spell names in the TOC and titles.
Easy Access:
The module adds a charming bookmark-style button to the side of the UI. Clicking it opens the spellbook for the currently selected character.
The vertical position of this bookmark button can also be adjusted in the settings.
The entire spellbook window can be moved freely by using the drag handle at the top.
